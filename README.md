JobScope is a modern job discovery web application that helps job seekers explore opportunities from multiple sources, tailor their resumes to specific roles, and apply with confidence — all through a clean, user-focused interface.

This project is intentionally designed to be ethical, legal, and platform-compliant. JobScope does not scrape job boards, does not host applications, and does not embed proprietary content. Instead, it focuses on UI/UX excellence, safe integrations, and AI-assisted resume optimization (opt-in).
