## 📖 About

JobScope is a modern job discovery web application designed to help job seekers explore opportunities from multiple sources, tailor their resumes to specific roles, and apply with confidence.

The platform is built with a **UI-first** approach and strict compliance standards. JobScope does not scrape job boards, host job applications, or embed proprietary review content. All job listings redirect users to the original source.
